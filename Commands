So what to do once client-pod and client-node-port yaml files are ready

To start MiniKube
    sudo minikube start
To check Kubectl cluster status
    kubectl cluster-info
Run client-pod file & client-node-port file
    kubectl apply -f client-pod.yaml
    kubectl apply -f client-node-port.yaml 
To Check pod status    
    kubectl get pods
To check services status
    kubectl get services
To view the ip which needs to be accessed to view application
    sudo minikube ip
To view if pods are running with correct information
    kubectl describe <objectType> <objectName>
